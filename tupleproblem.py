"""Now that you’re writing longer programs, ideas about how to style your code 
are worthwhile to know. Take the time to make your code as easy as possible 
to read. Writing easy-to-read code helps you keep track of what your pro
grams are doing and helps others understand your code as well.
 Python programmers have agreed on a number of styling conven
tions to ensure that everyone’s code is structured in roughly the same way. 
Once you’ve learned to write clean Python code, you should be able to 
understand the overall structure of anyone else’s Python code, as long as 
they follow the same guidelines. If you’re hoping to become a professional 
programmer at some point, you should begin following these guidelines as 
soon as possible to develop good habits"""
